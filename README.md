## Implementation by Ishida Kaete
The following tasks were completed successfully:

1. To run the project locally, the following environment variable was added: 
   REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/
   After setting this, I was able to log into the application using the provided credentials:
   
   Email: admin@gmail.com
   Password: admin123

2. I implemented RESTful APIs for the Meeting module on both the server and client sides. The application supports full operations (Create, View, Delete, Delete   Many) for meeting instances.

Note: MongoDB was required to run the project and had to be installed separately.

3. I added the video link to show my work result here
